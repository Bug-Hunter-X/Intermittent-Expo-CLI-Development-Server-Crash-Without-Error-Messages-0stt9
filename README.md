# Expo CLI Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates an issue where the Expo CLI development server intermittently crashes without providing any error messages. The crash is unpredictable and occurs across multiple projects and platforms (iOS and Android).

## Steps to Reproduce

The exact steps to reproduce are inconsistent, due to the intermittent nature of the bug. However, some potential triggers observed include:

* Making significant changes to the app code (adding large components or significant code alterations).
* Extended periods of development without restarting the server. 
* Specific device/simulator configurations. 

## Expected Behavior

The development server should continue running without unexpected crashes, providing informative error messages when issues are detected.

## Actual Behavior

The server abruptly stops without any warning or error logs. Live reload stops, and debugging capabilities are lost.

## Solution

(See expoBugSolution.js for potential workarounds or fixes. Note that this issue may be related to system resource limitations or underlying dependencies)
