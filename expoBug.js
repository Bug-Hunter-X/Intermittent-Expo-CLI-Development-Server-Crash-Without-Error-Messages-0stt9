While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without providing any specific error messages in the terminal. This was intermittent and difficult to debug, as it didn't leave any trace in the logs or error reports. The crash would manifest as the server abruptly shutting down, requiring a restart of the Expo CLI to resume development.  The application itself would continue running on the device/simulator, but the live reload functionality and debugging capabilities provided by the server were lost. This occurred across multiple projects and platforms (iOS and Android).
